## App Brainstorming

## Notes
I had more diffculty recording the walkthrough, I think this project was 
quite fun and the instructions were very clear!


## App Brainstorming
Reddit
- The design of Reddit emphasizes user-generated content, fostering a sense of community and collaboration.
- The app's menu system and subreddit structure make it easy to navigate through different topics and discussions.
Spotify
- Spotify boasts a clean and intuitive interface that prioritizes ease of use. The app's design facilitates smooth music exploration and playback.
  The use of album covers, artist images, and a visually appealing layout contributes to an engaging and enjoyable user experience.
Goodnotes
- GoodNotes is primarily designed for digital note-taking, with a focus on handwriting and annotation.
- The app often adopts a notebook-style interface, mimicking physical notebooks, which can provide a familiar and visually appealing experience for users.
- Excels in handwriting recognition, allowing users to write notes using a stylus or their fingers with precision.

App Ideas: 
I have always enjoyed reading in my free time, but more often than not I spend a significant amount of time trying to find a book to read 
than actually reading one. It would be nice to create an app that provides suggestions based on a variety of inputs. This can be from authors, 
genre (subgenres too I would love to get nitty gritty with the recommendations), themes, time period, etc. I think this would be something that 
a lot of fellow bookworms would enjoy. If possible, there are also times where I forget the title of the book, but I have a great idea of the general 
plot and even characters within the story. This app would include a feature that provides the title of the unkown book within my app
