## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
I had more diffculty recording the walkthrough, I think this project was 
quite fun and the instructions were very clear!


## App Brainstorming
Reddit, Spotify, Everand. 
 - User interface is fantastic.
 - the ability to create specific libraries/ playlists for favorite songs/ books (Spotify and Everand).
   with reddit you can also be apart of various groups/ communities that are seperate from one another.
 - I like the organization of every app, caterogized into different menus allows for ease of use.
